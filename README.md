# Volleyball Page

This MERN stack application was created for my volleyball team. I wanted to create a team resource page for the players, parents, and coaches. 

## Getting Started

### Instructions

On the homepage you can see where games are listed and scheduled and any additional information needed for that specific game. If you create a log in, you can create games, add a team roster, and post a schedule. Future enhancements include connecting to the google API to allow parents to get directions, post pictures, and announcements.
